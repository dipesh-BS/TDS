eShopCo streams latency pings from every storefront to a small FastAPI service. Product managers want a serverless endpoint they can call from dashboards to check whether a deployment stays under target latency.

Download the sample telemetry bundle  and deploy a Python endpoint on Vercel.

Your endpoint must:

Accept a POST request with JSON body {"regions": [...], "threshold_ms": 180}
Return per-region metrics: avg_latency (mean), p95_latency (95th percentile), avg_uptime (mean), and breaches (count of records above threshold)
Enable CORS for POST requests from any origin
We'll send {"regions":["apac","emea"],"threshold_ms":178} to your endpoint and verify the response (order doesn't matter).

What is the POST endpoint URL?
